Payeh is a comprehensive, full-stack web application built with **React** on the frontend and **Node.js/Express** on the backend. It provides an integrated suite of tools for personal productivity and team collaboration, allowing users to manage daily tasks, utilize a Pomodoro timer for focused work, and communicate in private chat channels.

## ✨ Key Features

This application combines several powerful features into a seamless user experience:

-   **👤 User & Profile Management:**
    -   Secure user registration and login handled by Supabase Auth [cite: `mrrmansd01/payeh/Payeh-a9bf7c3b159bcb55da30765e68a4de878a6aea0b/api/routes/auth.js`].
    -   Users can view and edit their profile information, including their name, username, and avatar image [cite: `mrrmansd01/payeh/Payeh-a9bf7c3b159bcb55da30765e68a4de878a6aea0b/client/src/pages/MyAccount.jsx`].
    -   Profile pictures are uploaded directly to Supabase Storage for secure cloud hosting [cite: `mrrmansd01/payeh/Payeh-a9bf7c3b159bcb55da30765e68a4de878a6aea0b/client/src/pages/MyAccount.jsx`].

    -   Tasks can be categorized with a score (1-3), which contributes to the user's position on the leaderboard [cite: `mrrmansd01/payeh/Payeh-a9bf7c3b159bcb55da30765e68a4de878a6aea0b/client/src/pages/Calendar.jsx`].

    -   Users can add new tasks directly to a specific date via an integrated modal form.

-   **⏱️ Productivity Tools:**

## 🚀 Local Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/MrRMansd01/Payeh.git](https://github.com/MrRMansd01/Payeh.git)
    cd Payeh
    ```

2.  **Install Server Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd api
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install Client Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Configure Supabase Credentials:**
    > **⚠️ Important:** This project contains hardcoded Supabase keys for simplicity. In a production environment, you must use environment variables to protect your credentials.

    You will need to replace the placeholder keys with your own Supabase project keys in two files:
    -   **Client-side:** Open `client/src/supabaseClient.js` and update `supabaseUrl` and `supabaseAnonKey` [cite: `mrrmansd01/payeh/Payeh-a9bf7c3b159bcb55da30765e68a4de878a6aea0b/client/src/supabaseClient.js`].
    -   **Server-side:** Open `api/supabaseClient.js` and update `supabaseUrl` and `supabaseKey` [cite: `mrrmansd01/payeh/Payeh-a9bf7c3b159bcb55da30765e68a4de878a6aea0b/api/supabaseClient.js`].

## ▶️ Running the Application

To run the application, you need to start both the backend and frontend servers concurrently.

1.  **Start the Server:**
    In a terminal, navigate to the `api` directory and run:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The backend server will start on `http://localhost:3001`.

2.  **Start the Client:**
    In a separate terminal, navigate to the `client` directory and run:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The React development server will start and open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
